## Logo

Standing for "lab", the conical flask is consisted of four simple but unique patterns, conveying our 3 main characteristics: simple, mysterious and powerful.  

- The interior of the conical flask is hollowed out, leaving space for a "K".
- The vertexes are rounded, while the inside is sharp, which represents our value of the blend of delicacy and force.
- The conical flask has a tilt of 37 degrees.
- Its colors are well designed to fit whenever the light or dark backgrounds, indicating that we are infinitely adaptable.

Hint:
- Leave space for the logo to breath.
- You may use it as an icon when refering to Katorly Lab.
- Please DO NOT remake one on your own and refer it to us.

We use [Outfit](https://github.com/Outfitio/Outfit-Fonts) font for our wordmark, for the font is perfect, modern, clean and rounded with slight contrast.  

- There are only two colors of the wordmark, when the background is light, use the default one; when the background is dimmed, use the light one.

Hint:
- Leave space for the wordmark to breath just like you when displaying it.
- Use it in situations where you can only display words, or pairing it with other wordmarks showing partnerships.
- Please DO NOT type the wordmark out.

## Watermark

Use the 50%-transparent white logo as a watermark.  

If the target position of the watermark in the image is completely white, use the 50%-transparent colored logo as a watermark instead.  

- Its size should be 5% smaller than the image.
- When adding it to an image that is `X * Y` large, its position `(x, y)` should be at: `(0.95 * X, Y - 0.05 * X)`.
